Most of the materials for the Cronkite School's data journalism course taught by Knight Chair Sarah Cohen are kept here. It's also a holding center for some other presentations, like FOIA workshops.

This site is replacing a lot of the other sites I've made over the years to collect data reporting and public records materials. I'm trying to get more organized. If you're looking for those, you've probably been redirected here. It's also an attempt to rein in dead links and outdated materials that no longer work.
