# Grouping with pivot tables
{: .no_toc}



"Group By" is a universal concept in data -- it means counting, summing or otherwise summarizing raw records into by group. If you have a list of people and the high school they attended, a *group by* operation will give you the number of people by high school.

In Excel, grouping is done with *pivot tables*.

Here are two excellent tutorials on pivot tables. There's no need to re-create them here.


* The Data Journalism Textbook project's [Group By tutorial for Excel](https://github.com/datajtext/DataJournalismTextbook/blob/master/Modules/GroupBy/group_by_with_excel.md
) by Matt Waite. To get the data, go to the [Data page in that project](https://github.com/datajtext/DataJournalismTextbook/tree/master/Data) and right-click on the mountainlions.csv file. Then choose "Save As" to prevent it from opening in Github.

* [Mary Jo Webster's tutorial](http://mjwebster.github.io/DataJ/pivottables.html) is pretty comprehensive with lots of screen shots.

For a detailed walkthrough on a season of baseball scores, see the "[Arizona Diamondback scores]({{site.baseurl}}/excel/practice/12-excel-baseball)" tutorial under "[Excel practice]({{site.baseurl}}/excel/xlpractice)"


Finding good practice datasets can take some practice. Here are a few that offer good potential.  If you want to find your own, try to find data sets that contain individual records, not statistics.

  * [Baseball salaries]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/data/xlexamples/MLB2011.xlsx)
  * [Traffic stops]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/data/xlexamples/saintanthony_police.xlsx) obtained from St. Anthony, Minn., after a police officer fatally shot a black motorist named Philandro Castile.
