* [Original FBI spreadsheet](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2016/crime-in-the-u.s.-2016) We're going to walk through this page, since there's some important information there, and look at the spreadsheet they provide.

* A cleaned-up version of the dataset [post the dataset]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/data/xlexamples/crime2016.xlsx) for us to use while you're reading about the UCR.
