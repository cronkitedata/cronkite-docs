title: Designing your own database

Building your own database involves keeping tidy data concepts in mind while minimizing the amount of work that you'll have to do to fill it out. In other words, you should be conscious of how you might want to use the data while at the same time being realistic about what you can reasonably get.

There are a few common reasons to design and build your own data for stories:

* There is a long-running story that is periodically updated with new documents or events that you want to keep track of, including background information. An example might be a bankruptcy that drags on for years, or a person who is continually in the news. One reporter in the '90's created a spreadsheet to log each event related to Jack Kevorkian, a famous doctor who helped people commit suicide.

* You are getting information from disparate sources and you need an easy way to search them, arrange them chronologically, and keep track of what you need to verify.

* You obtain records in a way that is impractical to scrape or convert to a database automatically, such as hand-written or scanned forms, individual case files, or court records.

In each of these, the database you build will be presumably used for published stories, so making sure you have validation and proper data typing is key.

## Tools for building a database

You can always just build your data in Excel or Google Sheets, but those tools will allow you to make many mistakes. Instead, think about using Google Forms or Airtable, an online data collection instrument that you can customize for your work. (The free version is limited to 2,000 rows per project, but the paid version is very inexpensive -- something like $7 / month. )


Think of your own database in four ways:

1. Unit of analysis - there may be more than one you care about
2. Ease of data entry
3. Statistical summary vs. narrative
4. Fact checking and data sourcing

The process of building your own database is somewhat iterative. You start with what you think you want, then reevaluate after you've tried 5 to 10 entries.

## Some examples

### Chronologies

In 2013, I was working on a story on police-involved domestic violence. One case was going to be used for an example of an agency that had ignored best practices in the past, based largely on an internal investigation that was done after a Christmas Eve incident. You can see the internal investigation here -- after looking at it, you may conclude what I did: I can't follow the timeline. So I typed key elements into a spreadsheet, which let me later sort it by date.

### Disciplinary records

Here is an example of school disciplinary records.


## Unit of analysis

Your first choice is the unit of analysis you want to record.
