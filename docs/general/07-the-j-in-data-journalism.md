## Read like a writer

Getting started in data journalism often feels as if you've left the newsroom and entered the land of statistics, computer programming and data science.
Remember to approach data or empirical reporting as a reporter first, and a consumer second -- how were the stories discovered, reported and constructed? Why is one thing news and another is not? What would you do differently or what did they miss that might suggest a different story?

Go beyond the obvious:

* Where might the reporters have found their key examples, and what made them good characters or illustrations of the larger issue? Could they have come from the data?

* What do you think came first -- a narrative single example that was broadened by data (naively, qualitative method), or a big idea that was illustrated with characters (quantitative method)?

* What records were used? Were they public records, leaks, or proprietary data?

* What methods did they use? Did they do their own testing, use statistical analysis, or geographic methods? You won't always know, but look for a methodology section or a description alongside each story.

* How  might you localize or adapt these methods to find your own stories?

* Pick out the key findings (usually in the nut graf or in a series of bullets after the opening chapter): are they controverial? How might they have been derived? What might have been the investigative hypothesis?  Have they given critics their due and tried to falsify their own work?

* How effective is the writing and presentation of the story? What makes it compelling journalism rather than a dry study? How might you have done it differently? Is a video story better told in text, or would a text story have made a good documentary? Are the visual elements well integrated? Does the writing draw you in and keep you reading? Think about structure, story length, entry points and graphics all working together.

* Are you convinced? Are there holes or questions that didn't get addressed?

## Analyze data for story, not study

As journalists we'll often be using data, social science methods and even interviewing differently than true experts. We're seeking stories, not studies. Recognizing news in data is one of the hardest skills for less experienced reporters new to data journalism. This list of potential newsworthy data points is adapted from Paul Bradshaw's "[Data Journalism Heist](https://leanpub.com/DataJournalismHeist)".

* Compare the claims of powerful people and institutions against facts -- the classic investigative approach.
* Report on *unexpected* highs and lows (of change, or of some other characteristic)
* Look for outliers -- individual values that buck a trend seen in the rest
* Verify or bust some myths
* Find signs of distress, happiness or dishonesty or any other emotion.
* Uncover *new* or *under-reported* long-term trends.
* Find data suggesting your area is *the same* or *different* than most others of its kind.

Bradshaw also did a recent study of data journalism pieces: "[Here are the angles journalists use most often to tell the stories in data](https://onlinejournalismblog.com/2020/08/11/here-are-the-7-types-of-stories-most-often-found-in-data/)", in Online Journalism Blog. I'm not sure I agree, only because he's looking mainly at visualizations rather than stories, but they're worth considering.
