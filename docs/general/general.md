These are tutorials and resources that don't depend on any particular method or technology. Some are just links to resources, others are longer tipsheets or tutorials.

As you go through them, remember that as journalists we'll often be using these tools differently than true experts. We're seeking stories, not studies. Borrowing from Paul Meyer's "Data Journalism Heist", we're often looking for news by seeking:

* Comparison of what powerful people and institutions claim vs. what they do
* *Unexpected* highs and lows (of change, or of some other characteristic)
* Individual values that buck a trend seen in the rest (outliers)
* Myths or myth-busting.
* Signs of distress, happiness or dishonesty.
* Newly discovered long-term trends

Here are some presentations I've done that fit into the "General" category:

* [The Data Journalism Ecosystem](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1vYVIdPUSXiwXArLCRvxPH53FB7zkEMViXieOM-CNkoE), Nov. 2017, for the Cronkite School first-year journalism students.
* [Empirical Journalism]({{ "assets/docs/empirical-j-intro-bootcamp.pdf" | relative_url }}), a regularly updated survey of data-driven reporting.
* [Investigative techniques](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1R5tJfimEapghi9FofWliiUpqVmEdfn_-vQQjRDMSQu4/edit?usp=sharing), a more detailed deconstruction of a few stories to show how to find and use records in hard-to-quantify stories.
