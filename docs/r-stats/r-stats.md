## R resources

Here are several other sources for you to review if you want to try something different on your own:

* [Matt Waite's sports data](http://mattwaite.github.io/sports/index.html) analysis and visualization course from the Univ. of Nebraska.
* [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/), an online textbook written by Hadley Wickham, inventor of the tidyverse.
* [Intro to Data Science for the Social Sector](https://ds4ps.github.io/Data-Science-Class/TEXTBOOK/docs/introduction-to-r.html), Jesse Lecy, from the ASU Program Evaluation and Data Analytics. This is much more a startup in R than a course in program evaluation.
* First 5 chapters of Sharon Machlis' [Practical R for Mass Communication and Journalism](http://www.machlis.com/R4Journalists/index.html). The [entire book](https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Mass-Communication-Journalism-Chapman/dp/1138726915) should be available by early 2019.


I don't know how to put the rendered HTML into this format, so here's a link to the tutorials and R Markdown files that we've used in class:

### February 13 2019

* Getting started with R Markdown and R: [Document](r-notebooks.html)  and the  [R notebook](rmd-files/01-1-notebooks.Rmd)
* Intro to data frames:  [Document](r-data-frames.html) and the [R notebook](rmd-files/01-2-dataframes.Rmd)
