Here are some of the data files used in other tutorials:

* [Phoenix city worker salaries]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/data/xlexamples/phoenix_salaries.xlsx)
* [Tempe opioid EMS calls]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/data/csv/opioidemscalls.csv)
* [Nebraska mountain lion sightings]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/data/csv/mountainlions.csv)

And some thoughts on where you can find more practice data:

* State and local open government web sites. Some are great, others, not so much.
* public.enigma.com and data.world, often cataloged in Google data
* Look at the [data sourcing]({{site.baseurl}}/general/sourcing) for more ideas.
