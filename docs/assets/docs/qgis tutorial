QGIS tutorial

Using qgis long-term release as of 2/22/20

I. Getting around the screen.
II. Adding an existing map file (shp, kml, etc.)
  a) How to know what the projection is?
  b) adding open street map to the background layer?
  c) Converting a polygon to point using the centroid?
  d) Joining with a data file.
  e) Spatial join from polygon to point  - the easiest. Applies characteristics from one to the other so you can aggregate them. Example: You have a list of cities, you want to aggregate them by county. A common thing to do is to have addresses, and you want to aggregate them by Census Tract. You'll often use census shapefiles in your work.
  f) Spatial join from point to polygon - you want to aggregate points by counting or summing their characteristics into the polygon they fall.


  Looks like you can use any street layer from the MMQGIS plugin. I don't know if they'll be able to apply the plugin in class the labs. We'll see.
