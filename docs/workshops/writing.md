Most stories that turn on narratives could be helped by creating your own data, especially a simple spreadsheet that can be sorted and filtered for exactly what you want.

Partway through the story, we turn from the case of Michelle O'Connell to show that this was not the first time that the county sheriff had declined to investigate accusations of domestic violence.

<blockquote>
A year before that, Sheriff Shoar’s disciplinary posture had been called into question in a domestic violence case involving a deputy named Halford (Bubba) Harris II.
<br><br>
Two supervisors learned of accusations that Mr. Harris had abused his wife. But no investigation was immediately opened, records show.
<br><br>
One sergeant did prepare an affidavit documenting the accusations. But he was told by his supervisor to hold it back, so he stuck it under the visor in his squad car, where it remained, even after another officer became aware of further incidents, according to Mr. Harris’s internal affairs file.
<br><br>
The case came to a head on Christmas Eve, when his wife fled their house and called the police. Internal affairs officers uncovered other possible acts of domestic violence before his hiring, records show. His wife said that before they married, he had held a knife to her throat and hit her. His ex-wife said he had threatened her with a gun. No charges were filed.
<br><br>
Col. Todd R. Thompson, the sheriff’s director of law enforcement, recommended that Mr. Harris be fired, saying his actions were “particularly egregious and trouble me deeply.”
<br><br>
In an interview, Mr. Harris insisted that he had never engaged in domestic abuse: “Is there proof?”
<br><br>
“They’re telling one story,” he added. “I’ll tell you another one.” He said the state attorney brought no charges and noted that, though they divorced after the Christmas Eve incident, his wife later wrote a letter of support, calling him “a wonderful man and father.”
<br><br>
Sheriff Shoar overruled the dismissal recommendation, citing mitigating factors, like an “exemplary” work record and an absence of citizen complaints.
<br><br>
“I hope you understand how fortunate you are to receive a second chance,” the sheriff wrote to his deputy.
<br><br>
After the decision leaked out and caused an uproar, Mr. Harris said, he was pressured to resign. He is now a deputy in a nearby county.

Much of this passage came from a series of internal affairs reports done after the last incident.
