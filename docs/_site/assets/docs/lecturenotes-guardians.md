# Background on Misplaced Trust #
* Evolved out of an anecdotal story from a beat, by Carol Leonnig. Often the source of the best stories.
* Court refused to provide records. We eventually got them, but could not have done the story without them
* Records did not exist in a way that would allow for the analysis we wanted to do, so we cleaned them up and matched them against other records to get the data.
* Different from anecdote because we knew our examples were typical, regardless of what the court said it did.
* No one else had ever done this story, at least in this way. Several years later, the LA Times won a lot of awards for a story very much like this one.

It's a pretty classic, and straightforward, example of computer-assisted reporting. It's not the biggest story ever, nor the most complex, nor the most groundbreaking in methods. But it shows what can be done just with a couple of data sets and some elbow grease: use original research to hold a system up to scrutiny, and examine its performance against its own standards. In this case, they were judges' own orders and local law.

## Virgnina Hinton ##
Meet Virginia Hinton. The best description of her came from the story: 

> Virginia Hinton was a Radcliffe graduate,
world traveler and the former wife of a history
scholar. But in her most vulnerable years, her
life came undone. She suffered first from alcoholism,
then mild dementia. At 75, she owned a
house in Rockville but ended up living on street corners.

Ms Hinton was left on the streets by the system that had promised to protect her. A court-appointed guardian told judges that she “preferred to live on the streets,” but that she also complained that her furniture was urine-soaked when Ms. Hinton would come by each month for her living money. Where that money went no one knows. The lawyer, Rozan Cater, was found to have misplaced at least $250,000 from clients’ accounts. In Hinton’s case, she failed to use the  money to pay property taxes. She let it go so long that the county confiscated her property.

Ms. Hinton one of the people we found in a corner of the courthouse – one better known for wills and estate battles – called Probate Court (Surrogate's Court in New York State).  Judges there decide whether the old and infirm are vulnerable enough – and alone enough – to warrant assigning a guardian or conservator to protect their interests. The Washington Post’s story, like most others on this court around the country, found that once that guardian was assigned, no one bothered to check on how they were doing despite laws requiring the court to oversee the care. 

Our story focused on the lawyers who were on a voluntary list to be assigned to this task. They get paid very little when the ward is poor, but can get a windfall by managing wealthy clients' cash. 

### Bottom-up reporting ###
This was an example of bottom-up reporting. We looked at the docket for the earlier case, and tried to find the M.O. We had to go through several more examples before we knew what would be required to get it right.

I use the term to mean that you start with one example or tip, dip back into the data to see if you can find another, go back to the field and check it out. 

Rinse, repeat.

Keep going between field and lab, field and lab until you've assured yourself you know what can go wrong with your analysis and what it will take to get it right. You might stop here -- we often do -- with several very good cases and practices that illustrate problems when you realize you can't go further.

Examples finding examples and moving on:

* Part One of the story you'll read later on on the Bronx Courts. The later story was driven by bottom-up data work.
* Recent story in the Times on military hospitals, which was inspired by entries in a database, but reported in a more traditional way.
* Upcoming story on Rikers, I think. I can't tell you much about it now, but you'll know it when you see it.

Bottom-up often has a phrase in it about "the most" or "one of the most" -- it alerts you to an outlier.

### Top-down reporting 

Sometimes, when you can't get individual records, you have to try to drill down from statistics. It's often more explanatory than investigative; often geographic. It depends on you knowing what you are looking for, and how that trend would look in the data. It also means you can't be sure how your example looks in the original data. It's a fall-back.


## Getting the data
	
The analysis portion of this story began with serendipity. Two reporters, then working on a project about a woman who had been unfairly placed into a conservatorship and held hostage in a DC nursing home by a judge, visited the chief judge of our Superior Court. (She happened to be the Commerce Dept. official who invented the formula used to determine whether families lived in poverty.)  During the reporting on that case and one earlier one, the court had removed from the probate division the only computer that allowed us to look up probate cases. The just got rid of it. 

Carol and Sari Horwitz, who I'd worked with on two other projects, asked me to come to see if we could get Judge King to give us access again. At that meeting, in June 2002, King said he would make a terminal available in the depths of the building, and directed his IT staff to work it out with us. He refused to turn over a copy of the docket electronically, saying he preferred to keep it in the building. Meanwhile, Sari moved to a different story and Lena Sun joined the project.

We went over there and started looking up cases. It turns out that their system didn't allow us to find all of the cases of any lawyer, so we were going to have to look at them all just to get the history on a particular attorney., We'd just have to go case by case, screen by screen and download each. A guy named Ron was assigned to mind us. Lena brought cookies, one of us showed up every day and just sat there downloading the cases onto a floppy disk. 

We'd spent a week or so and downloaded what we needed for just a handful of cases. When they asked how long we'd need access to their systems and the building, we said it could take a year. We promised to keep bringing cookies. Then they asked what it would take to get rid of us.
We said, if they would just give us the database, we'd be gone the next day. They did.  We had it on tape a few days later, in July of 2002. I don't think Judge King ever realized we got the full docket. He never asked how we did this.

Now came the hard part – trying to decipher the codes in the dockets to see if we could identify lawyers and to find cases in which a guardian had been punished for neglecting his ward. 


## Virginia Hinton docket##

### Docket headers ###

The first thing to notice is that the named people in the case, Ken Loewinger and Stephanie Grogan, among others, are not Rozan Cater – the lawyer who left her on the streets. In fact, there is no mention of Cater until you get way lower in the docket. That's why their in-house search wouldn't work.

But there are a few hints here that something has gone awry.  The first is the code next to Loewinger’s name that says “SC” and “SG” – Ron had helpfully given us a list of about 300 codes that are inconsistently used in the dockets and their meanings. These ones mean “Successor conservator” and “Successor guardian”. It means this isn’t the first person to have custody of the ward. Either the previous guardian resigned, died, or was stripped of her powers. 

There’s another hint on this record that it might have  victim: An estimated value of the estate at $320,000. 

### Section 2###
Here is the next section of this docket: It is where cater’s name first comes up – 2 ½ years after first being appointed to care for Hinton’s health and safety and money, she filed her first accounting of the funds. These are supposed to be filed every year. Let me walk through with you some interesting pieces of this docket:

-- After being reminded by the court, Cater filed a “Guardianship report” in December 1996– only about 3 months after it was first due, and after being reminded. But then 2 ½ years go by before the court notices that anything was wrong and sent a delinquency notice (which was ignored) and then scheduled what’s called a “show cause” hearing for “failure to file”.  The delinquencies continued until someone in the family – Page Stodder – noticed.  Virginia has now been on the streets for at least 4 years. She has at least temporarily lost her home because Cater had failed to pay property taxes (the county holds it for a time before selling it at a tax sale so she did eventually get it back.)

### Section 3 ###
Within a few months, Cater had been removed from the case and less than a year later she was referred to the lawyer’s disciplinary committee for failure to account for the missing funds. But she was never punished by the judge: She was allowed to resign rather than be fired from the case, was left on the list of attorneys eligible for new appointments, and was only referred to bar counsel after Loewinger did a full accounting – something that, save Page Stodder’s discovery of her aunt’s condition would normally never happen.

The other problem I just want to note for the data nerds in the room is to notice the code next to the “referred to bar counsel” . That is supposed to be real code – ORBC, for Order to Refer to Bar Counsel. It wasn’t used, but instead was "TT00" indicating a free-text field. 	 

What this case showed us was what to look for in a case that might have these problems. So I did some searches that created specific lists that we could go check out – any mention of a bar counsel, and mention of “granting leave to resign” or, worse, “order of removal”; 

These lists gave us the fodder to go back to the original records and the street to check out what happened in other cases.

##Gloria Johnson##
Gloria Johnson was another lawyer who repeatedly received appointments from judges even though she had failed to do basic work, from showing up at hearings to filing any reports on the status of her wards. She was repeatedly punished by judges, but then just as quickly appointed to new jobs. 

In all, the Post found that judges had appointed lawyers 240 times over about 10 years AFTER they had imposed sanctions for failing to do their jobs. In a small system, as DC’s in – and in cases in which the only time sanctions were imposed was when someone complained – this was a staggering number.

##Analysis of oversight##
One of the analyses we conducted was to find out how often basic laws were followed in the care of the wards. This posed a particular problem: By definition, these wards were alone with no responsible family members or close friends to oversee their care. Many were unable to coherently talk themselves, and had limited credibility. Moreover, many died within months of being put under a guardian’s care.

So we could not evaluate how many were neglected, abused or otherwise victimized. All we could do was ask, “is anyone watching?” and the resounding answer was, “NO”. By law, the only oversight of guardians comes from the Probate court in DC. And by law, every guardian must turn in a form every six months attesting to the visits he made to the ward, changes in their health and any differences in their living conditions. 

From court dockets, we were able to find 783 cases in which a guardian was assigned for at least a year (most of the rest died before a year was out.) In nearly half, the court had not heard back from the guardian in over 18 months. In about a sixth of the cases, the court NEVER received a report. And the court did little to prod them or inquire about the resident’s health or well-being.

## The other side of the coin ##
While we were looking at this problem, we started seeing the other side of the problem: people shoved into guardianship who didn't feel like they needed it, or who had no meaningful review of the request by the judges.

### No data? Get your own ###
There were certain steps required by law to have a guardian appointed, and we suspected they were being sidestepped. But the only record of what happened was in the paper records in the courthouse. 

We arranged for four of us to go to the courthouse one day and review every case filed over six months. (As an aside, we found our dockets were far more accurate than the paper documents, which were often misfiled or otherwise inaccurately identifying court dates and other key pieces of information. The judge relies on the docket. No one really looks at the case file.) 



##Lessons for investigative reporting##
* What is supposed to happen? Compared to what? In these cases, we had easy comparisons: they were right in the judges' orders and in the local law.
* Find one case you know about, look for the M.O. Virginia Hinton was our case. It led us toward the codes and phrases in the docket we should seek for other examples.
* Focus on time, place and people
* Matching lists -- eligible lawyers, dockets. We had to distinguish family members from lawyers, so used the eligibility list to isolate them.
* Often requires programming - you would have a hard time looking for how long between reports if you had to do this using Excel or an SQL product. 
* What you start doing is rarely what you end up doing. We started with a single conservatorship case, ended up focusing on guardians. Reason: There were many more, and these were the people who needed the help the most.
* Look at both sides of a coin: people neglected in the system; people in the system who shouldn't be.

## Reaction ##

This was the strangest reaction I've ever seen. We spent at least 4 hours with Judge King going over our results with him. He just didn't engage. No matter how many times we told him the problems were rampant, he saw them as cases that fell through the cracks.

He called the day the story ran and said he just didn't get it until he saw it on the front page of the paper, all laid out with data and stories. It was a powerful reminder that people can know something is true, but not feel it, until we do our jobs.
