FBI crime statistics
We're going to look at Uniform Crime Reports for 2017 in class. Read these stories to see how reporters handle them, taking note of the caveats they use. This is a good example of data that you are obligated to report, even though there are serious flaws. While reading, take special note of any definitions ("reported" crimes, not actual crimes, for example) , units of analysis ("cities", not states or counties) and other details that will help you know what you can and can't do with the data.

* [Original FBI spreadsheet](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2016/crime-in-the-u.s.-2016) We're going to walk through this page, since there's some important information there, and look at the spreadsheet they provide.

* A [cleaned-up version of the dataset]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/data/xlexamples/crime2016.xlsx) for us to use while you're reading about the UCR.
