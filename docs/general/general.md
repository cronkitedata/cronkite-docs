These are tutorials and resources that don't depend on any particular method or technology. Some are just links to resources, others are longer tipsheets or tutorials.

Here are some presentations I've done that fit into the "General" category:

* [The Data Journalism Ecosystem](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1vYVIdPUSXiwXArLCRvxPH53FB7zkEMViXieOM-CNkoE), Nov. 2017, for the Cronkite School first-year journalism students.
* [Empirical Journalism](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1jmpmzcsNc-S6OIIK_FcMXb0CMKI8yScX9Cy3uM_KEVU/edit?usp=sharing), a regularly updated survey of data-driven reporting.
* [Investigative techniques](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1R5tJfimEapghi9FofWliiUpqVmEdfn_-vQQjRDMSQu4/edit?usp=sharing), a more detailed deconstruction of a few stories to show how to find and use records in hard-to-quantify stories.
