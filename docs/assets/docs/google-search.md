Getting good at Google searches can help you narrow your results.  The search operators help your narrow down your search to words or phrases in a title, in a url, in the text. Sometimes, Google isn't very clear about how they work.

## Custom Google search

This page contains a Custom Google Search engine, made up of the members of the Institute for Non-Profit News (formerly Investigative News Network), an association in support of non-profit news sites big and small. These sites often don't get well indexed by Google, or come up late in the search results for a topic. Limiting them here will help you find less obvious examples of your story.

### Other searches

<footer>I would skip Nexis UNI -- it's the paid news archive service that is available to students, and it excludes almost anything you care about other than network news transcripts, The Washington Post and The New York Times. None of the Gannett, McClatchy or former Tribune or Knight news sources are included. Neither are the major non-profit news sites. </footer>

* [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/). Tips: Set the date to the last 10 years or so, and, if your topic is international, include "United States" in the search. Look at the number of citations for the closest result to your topic, and look at the pieces that reference that article. You might find better search terms there.
