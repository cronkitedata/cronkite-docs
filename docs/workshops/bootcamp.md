## FOIA

* *The Art of Access*, by David Cullier, is a great book for introducing you to techniques and approaches -- ways to get to "yes". It will be required in the data reporting class if you take it.

* [Cronkite School's FOIA resource pages](https://cronkitedata.github.io/foia/)


## Numbers in the newsroom

* [Slides from class](https://slides.com/sarahcnyt/numbers-in-the-newsroom)
* [Handout with common formulas for change, percents, etc.]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/docs/newsroom-numbers.pdf)

## Excel refresher

We'll work from a few tutorials:
* [Quick Excel refresher]({{site.baseurl}}/excel/xlguides/xl-refresher). Look here for keyboard shortcuts and short clips reminding you how to do basic navigation.
* Get used to the concept of [tidy data]({{site.baseurl}}/excel/xlguides/xl-tidydata))

Excel files we'll work with:
* [The budget from Phoenix]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/data/xlexamples/phx_budget_summary.xlsx)
* [An example of a homemade database]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/docs/viz/hundred-days/first100days.xlsx)
