### One approach

Ask these questions about any person, company or property: 

* What do they say about themselves? 
* What do others say about them? 
* What's missing from both accounts? 
* What has been mischaracterized (on purpose or by accident)?

<ul>
<li><a href="http://seethroughny.net/">SeeThroughNY</a>, a public interest group with New York city payroll, pension and contract information obtained through public records</li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/dof/html/property/property.shtml">New York City Finance Department</a> site contains property records, including mortgage and deed information. You will probably have to look up the block and lot information using the address lookup to get much information. I've had trouble with the latest Java problems getting the actual documents online.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.elections.ny.gov/CFViewReports.html">New York State campaign finance</a> office has searchable contributions</li>
<li>Many records require you go to the office to request information: <a href="https://voterlookup.elections.state.ny.us/">New York voter information</a> is only available online if you know the full name and date of birth of the person you're looking for.</li> 
<li><a href="https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/webcivil/ecourtsMain">New York State e-courts</a> include varying levels of access to criminal, civil, housing, family and other courts.</li>
<li>Don't forget about federal records: campaign finance through the Center for Responsive Politics, court cases and bankruptcies through PACER (a pay service that is very inexpensive), and business records from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Small Business Administration and the Environmental Protection Administration.  Many of these records are collected by <a href="http://enigma.io">Enigma.io</a> (free but you you have to sign up)</li>
