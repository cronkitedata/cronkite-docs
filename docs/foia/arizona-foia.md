## Arizona public records

* [Arizona Ombudsman's guide to public records](http://www.azoca.gov/open-meeting-and-public-records-law/overview/). The first document is the guide for state agency heads. Searching the attorney general decisions on this site can be quite useful.

* Read the FAQ and browse the Arizona Republic's [azpublicinfo.com](http://azpublicinfo.com/). From its home page, use the search or browse function to find some agencies that might relate to your topic.  Read the FAQ.

* Reporters' Committee for the Freedom of the Press [Arizona open records policy](https://www.rcfp.org/rcfp/orders/docs/ogg/AZ.pdf). You don't need to read this, just know it exists as a resource when you need it and what information it might contain.

* Center for Public Integrity's [State Integrity Index for Arizona](https://www.publicintegrity.org/2015/11/09/18332/arizona-gets-d-grade-2015-state-integrity-investigation), by Evan Wyloge, 2015. I'm not sure I agree with the overall grade, but the summary is good.
