These are tutorials and resources that don't depend on any particular method or technology. Some are just links to resources, others are longer tipsheets or tutorials.

As you go through them, remember that as journalists we'll often be using these tools differently than true experts. We're seeking stories, not studies. Borrowing from Paul Meyer's "Data Journalism Heist", we're often looking for news by seeking:

* Comparison of what powerful people and institutions claim vs. what they do
* *Unexpected* highs and lows (of change, or of some other characteristic)
* Individual values that buck a trend seen in the rest (outliers)
* Myths or myth-busting.
* Signs of distress, happiness or dishonesty.
* Newly discovered long-term trends

### Reading like a writer

When you read / view / listen to pieces of data journalism, try to take them apart as if you were going to do the story yourself.

* Where might the reporters have found their key examples, and what made them good characters or illustrations of the larger issue? Could they have come from the data?

* What do you think came first -- a narrative single example that was broadened by data, or a big idea that was illustrated with characters?

* What records were used? Were they public records, leaks, or proprietary data?  How  might you localize or adapt these methods to find your own stories?

* What methods did they use? Did they do their own testing, use statistical analysis, or geographic methods? You won't always know, but look for a methodology section in each story.

* Pick out the key findings (usually in the nut graf or in a series of bullets after the opening chapter): are they controverial? How might they have been derived? What standards are they measuring against? Have they given critics their due?

* How effective is the writing and presentation of the story? What makes it compelling journalism rather than a dry study? How might you have done it differently? Is a video story better told in text, or would a text story have made a good documentary? Are the visual elements well integrated? Does the writing draw you in and keep you reading? Think about structure, story length, entry points and graphics all working together.

* Are you convinced? Are there holes or questions that didn't get addressed?

### Data journalism presentations

* [The Data Journalism Ecosystem](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1vYVIdPUSXiwXArLCRvxPH53FB7zkEMViXieOM-CNkoE), Nov. 2017, for the Cronkite School first-year journalism students.
* [Empirical Journalism]({{ "assets/docs/empirical-j-intro-bootcamp.pdf" | relative_url }}), a regularly updated survey of data-driven reporting.
* [Investigative techniques](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1R5tJfimEapghi9FofWliiUpqVmEdfn_-vQQjRDMSQu4/edit?usp=sharing), a more detailed deconstruction of a few stories to show how to find and use records in hard-to-quantify stories.
