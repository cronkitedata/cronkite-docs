Building your own database involves keeping tidy data concepts in mind while minimizing the amount of work that you'll have to do to fill it out. In other words, you should be conscious of how you might want to use the data while at the same time being realistic about what you can reasonably get.

There are a few common reasons to design and build your own data for stories:

* There is a long-running story that is periodically updated with new documents or events that you want to keep track of, including background information. An example might be a bankruptcy that drags on for years, or a person who is continually in the news. One reporter in the '90's created a spreadsheet to log each event related to Jack Kevorkian, a famous doctor who helped people commit suicide.

* You are getting information from disparate sources and you need an easy way to search them, arrange them chronologically, and keep track of what you need to verify.

* 


Think of your own database in four ways:

1. Unit of analysis - there may be more than one you care about
2. Ease of data entry
3. Statistical summary vs. narrative
4. Fact checking and data sourcing

The process of building your own database is somewhat iterative. You start with what you think you want, then reevaluate after you've tried 5 to 10 entries.

### Chron




## Unit of analysis

Your first choice is the unit of analysis you want to record.
