# Reading like a writer

Data journalism isn't just technical work or data analytics. When you read or view a piece, try to read it as if you were going to do the story  yourself. Some things to look for:

* Where might the reporters have found their key examples, and what made them good characters or illustrations of the larger issue? Could they have come from the data?

* What do you think came first -- a narrative single example that was broadened by data, or a big idea that was illustrated with characters?

* What records were used? Were they public records, leaks, or proprietary data?  How  might you localize or adapt these methods to find your own stories?

* What methods did they use? Did they do their own testing, use statistical analysis, or geographic methods? You won't always know, but look for a methodology section in each story.

* Pick out the key findings (usually in the nut graf or in a series of bullets after the opening chapter): are they controverial? How might they have been derived? What standards are they measuring against? Have they given critics their due?

* How effective is the writing and presentation of the story? What makes it compelling journalism rather than a dry study? How might you have done it differently? Is a video story better told in text, or would a text story have made a good documentary? Are the visual elements well integrated? Does the writing draw you in and keep you reading? Think about structure, story length, entry points and graphics all working together.

* Are you convinced? Are there holes or questions that didn't get addressed?
