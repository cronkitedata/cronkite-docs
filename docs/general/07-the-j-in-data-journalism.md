## Analyze for story, not study

As journalists we'll often be using these tools differently than true experts. We're seeking stories, not studies. This list of potential newsworthy data points is adapted from Paul Bradshaw's "[Data Journalism Heist](https://leanpub.com/DataJournalismHeist)".

* Compare the claims of powerful people and institutions against facts -- the classic investigative approach.
* Report on *unexpected* highs and lows (of change, or of some other characteristic)
* Look for outliers -- individual values that buck a trend seen in the rest
* Verify or bust some myths
* Find signs of distress, happiness or dishonesty or any other emotion.
* Uncover *new* or *under-reported* long-term trends.
* Find data suggesting your area is *the same* or *different* than most others of its kind.

## Read like a writer

It also helps to read / watch / listen to stories as if you were a writer, not a member of the audience. Think about how the sources were discovered, what they each contributed to the stories and how documents and data played into the story. Go beyond the obvious:


* Where might the reporters have found their key examples, and what made them good characters or illustrations of the larger issue? Could they have come from the data?

* What do you think came first -- a narrative single example that was broadened by data, or a big idea that was illustrated with characters?

* What records were used? Were they public records, leaks, or proprietary data?  How  might you localize or adapt these methods to find your own stories?

* What methods did they use? Did they do their own testing, use statistical analysis, or geographic methods? You won't always know, but look for a methodology section in each story.

* Pick out the key findings (usually in the nut graf or in a series of bullets after the opening chapter): are they controverial? How might they have been derived? What standards are they measuring against? Have they given critics their due?

* How effective is the writing and presentation of the story? What makes it compelling journalism rather than a dry study? How might you have done it differently? Is a video story better told in text, or would a text story have made a good documentary? Are the visual elements well integrated? Does the writing draw you in and keep you reading? Think about structure, story length, entry points and graphics all working together.

* Are you convinced? Are there holes or questions that didn't get addressed?
