Here are some of the data files used in other tutorials:

* Phoenix city worker salaries
* Tempe opioid EMS calls
* Nebraska mountain lion sightings

And some thoughts on where you can find more practice data:

* State and local open government web sites. Some are great, others, not so much.
* public.enigma.com and data.world, often cataloged in Google data
