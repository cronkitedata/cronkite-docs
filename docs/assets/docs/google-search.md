## Custom Google search

This page contains a Custom Google Search engine, made up of the members of the Institute for Non-Profit News (formerly Investigative News Network), an association in support of non-profit news sites big and small. These sites often don't get well indexed by Google, or come up late in the search results for a topic. Limiting them here will help you find less obvious examples of your story.

* [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com) for academic research. Tip: Look under "citations" to find the most cited authors in your field. Then do a new search for that author, and look at some of the papers that included a citation.
