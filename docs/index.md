The sections are:

### [Excel](excel)

Tutorials and exercises using Excel for daily chores. These are conceptual as well as technical -- you'll find some of those concepts in repeated in other sections.

### [R stats](r-stats)

Some resources and markdown files for learning basic R to replace some of your Excel workflow.

### [Specialized tools](special)

Anything that is used for one purpose, such as OpenRefine for data cleaning, or the Chrome Scraper for scraping.
